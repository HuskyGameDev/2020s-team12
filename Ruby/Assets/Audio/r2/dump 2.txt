Hey guys this is quite a bulky dump, I'm pretty sure this is all the sfx you guys requested but if I'm missing anything dm me

hurt alt- Since the protagonist's mute I had a really hard time trying to find a grunt that sounds realistic without sounding like a cough so I made a hurt sound that sounds similar to the pokemon wall block noise

hurt vox- This is the closest I got in terms of a grunt but there's still vocalization audible so it's not as realistic.

monster1- sounds for the dark slime monster, I made them with how Isaac monsters groan in the rooms in mind

monster2- sounds for the eye monster. the groan sound effect, some variations in pitch, and a walking sound for it

projectilepop- a pop for when the projectiles hit the wall, but you could also use it for shooting sounds.

slimemove- these are the moving sounds for monster 1.

As usual if theres anything else get back to me ASAP.

I am working on the BGM at this moment, I'll try to get it to you guys by the end of tuesday at the latest, apologies.
